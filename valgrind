# --leak-check=full: "each individual leak will be shown in detail"

# --show-leak-kinds=all: Show all of "definite, indirect, possible, 
#    reachable" leak kinds in the "full" report.

# --track-origins=yes: Favor useful output over speed. This tracks the origins 
#    of uninitialized values, which could be very useful for memory errors. 
#    Consider turning off if Valgrind is unacceptably slow.

# --verbose: Can tell you about unusual behavior of your program. 
#    Repeat for more verbosity.

# --log-file: Write to a file. Useful when output exceeds terminal space.
